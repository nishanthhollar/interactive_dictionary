Loading this data into a python dictionary
Thats the best way to load the data to access a value and a key

 demonstration on how to load the data onto the python dictionary'

For that we need to use json standard library
standard - means inbuilt in json which means that we don't need to install it


import json
#now to load the data we use 
data = json.load(open("data.json"))
#here the default mode is write mode 
data = json.load(open("json_file"))
type(data)
is a class dict
when we print(data)
we get all the data stored in json 
data["rain"]
data["key"] --> then we get the value for the key 
if we input a function we get a key and then we print out the output
